# Predicting_Stay_Length_In_Hospital
In this project my team and I used many ML algoritmns XG-boost, random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression and KNN.
The best algorithm we tried for our dataset was the KNN for getting highest accuracy 92% and performance (least running time). The Random Forest comes next for getting accuracy 89% after oversampling.
